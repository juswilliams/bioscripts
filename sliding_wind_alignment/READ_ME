DESCRIPTION: 
retrieves nt conservation from 0 - 1 (1 being perfectly conserved)
at each site from a pair of aligned sequences.

USAGE: 
python scriptname.py infile.fasta outfile.tab windowsize
where infile == pairwise alignment, FASTA format, only two sequences
and windowsize is integer only (eg 100, 200, 500, 1000)

NOTES: 
Treats gaps (- and N) as 0, thus not conserved
